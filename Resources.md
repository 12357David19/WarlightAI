# Resources for the project


This is a collection of resources I found on this game AI so far. The computer game "Warlight" is based on the classic board game "Risk", so most of the documents are related to that.

I haven't gone through all these fully, but it's good to have all these in a place so that we can look at these when we need. I'll add more if I find anything interesting. Also, if you find anything interesting, you can add them too.

* A thesis done on AI of this game: published in 2005, so a lot has changed in between
